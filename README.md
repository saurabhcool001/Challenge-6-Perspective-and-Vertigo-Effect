# Challenge-6-Perspective-and-Vertigo-Effect

Vertigo Effect or dolly Zoom is a camera effect popularized by the famous director Hitchcock in his movie Vertigo. This technique requires the operator to push/pull the camera while zooming out/in. The combination of the displacement of the camera and changing of perspective together creates this creative camera effect. In this effect, the background either "shrinks or expands" while the subject at the centre stays at the same size.

This challenge asks you to realize this effect in your favourite environment (c++, c# or python).

Create a scene as the background with a character. Play with the virtual camera, change its position, and focal length (angle of perspective), to see what happens in the frame.

When you implement this effect, you can either "eye-ball" it or have more precious control with the details here:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_zoom

As usual, submit commented code and a short video showing the visual result.
